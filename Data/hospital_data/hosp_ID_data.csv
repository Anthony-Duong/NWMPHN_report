,"*The data presented by Local Government Area (LGA) have been estimated from population health areas (PHAs), as the LGA of usual residence was not more accurately geocoded (e.g., from the street address). These estimates are of variable quality, as the allocation from a PHA to one or more LGAs was based on the proportion of the total population falling within LGAs covered by the PHA. The proportional allocations are as provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) at the statistial area level 2 (SA2) level. However, the allocations are based on total populations: therefore, where the LGA is allocated a proportion of the cases from a PHA, it will not give an accurate allocation for the Aboriginal cases where there is a relatively large Aboriginal population.  For more information, refer to the Notes on the data.",,,,,,
